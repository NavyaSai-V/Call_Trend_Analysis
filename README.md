# Call Trend Analysis

We have learned to optimize the number of new recruits in the call center, Using Advance Excel we have
obtained the results. We have also understood about the use of automated technologies in this field like
Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Predictive Analytics, Intelligent
Routing to reduce the manpower and optimize the recruits. This is one of the best implementations of
the Excel in real life


## Case Study Description

Project Description:
The given data set consists of a Customer Experience (CX) Inbound calling team for 23 days. Data includes
Agent_Name, Agent_ID, Queue_Time [duration for which customer have to wait before they get
connected to an agent], Time [time at which call was made by customer in a day], Time_Bucket [for
easiness we have also provided you with the time bucket], Duration [duration for which a customer and
executives are on call, Call_Seconds [for simplicity we have also converted those time into seconds], call
status (Abandon, answered, transferred).

Let’s look at some of the most impactful AI-empowered customer experience tools you can use today:
Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Predictive Analytics, Intelligent
Routing.

In a Customer Experience team there is a huge employment opportunity for Customer service
representatives A.k.a. call center agents, customer service agents. Some of the roles for them include:
Email support, Inbound support, Outbound support, social media support.

To do this analysis we will first understand the given data and the problems we are going to deal during
the process. To decrease the number of abundant calls we are going to find the minimum number of
agents to be recruited. The number of new recruits may change according to initial assumptions.

**Approach:**

As we see in the data there are multiple N/A values in the Agent name and Agent ID we are not going to
deal with these values and there are no other blank values. We also checked for the duplicate values,
which we were not able to find.


After this we are going to deal with the given tasks by using Pivot tables, Pivot Charts and Excel Functions
to arrive to the obtained results.
## Tech Stack
